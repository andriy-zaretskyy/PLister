PLister
=======

This is a simple android application that allows you digitize your hand written lists.
This code is created with AndroidStudio.

**Known issues:** On budget devices there are OutOfMemoryError exceptions.

**For those who desperately need fixes and support:**
I've created the application for myself. I'm pretty happy with it.
If you need additional features or any fixes feel free to download the code and fix or whatever :)
